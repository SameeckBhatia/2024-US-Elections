Create a key-value pair connecting the following vectors:
states <- c("AL", "AK", "AR", "AZ", "CA", "CO", "CT")
districts <- c(7, 1, 9, 4, 52, 8, 5)

ChatGPT
To create a key-value pair connecting the states and districts vectors, you can use the setNames() function to associate each state with its corresponding district. Here's how you can do it:

r
Copy code
states <- c("AL", "AK", "AR", "AZ", "CA", "CO", "CT")
districts <- c(7, 1, 9, 4, 52, 8, 5)

state_district_map <- setNames(districts, states)
Now, state_district_map is a named vector where each state is the key, and the corresponding district is the value:

r
Copy code
print(state_district_map)
# AL  AK  AR  AZ  CA  CO  CT 
#  7   1   9   4  52   8   5 
You can access the district of any state by referencing its key, e.g., state_district_map["CA"] will return 52.

Is there a more efficient way to go about this:
districts <- c()

for(i in 1:n){
  districts[i] <- sample(1:num_districts[simulated_data$state[i]], 1)
}

simulated_data$district <- districts

ChatGPT
Yes, you can make the district assignment process more efficient by avoiding the loop and instead using vectorized operations. The goal is to assign districts based on the number of districts per state without having to loop through each row. You can achieve this by using mapply() or unlist(lapply()), which are more efficient than a for loop in R.

Here’s an optimized approach using mapply():

r
Copy code
# Assuming num_districts is a named vector that provides the number of districts for each state
num_districts <- c("AL" = 7, "AK" = 1, "AR" = 9, "AZ" = 4, "CA" = 52, "CO" = 8, "CT" = 5)

# Use mapply to efficiently assign random districts based on the state
simulated_data$district <- mapply(function(state) sample(1:num_districts[state], 1),
                                  simulated_data$state)
Explanation:
mapply() applies the sample() function across each state in simulated_data$state, assigning a random district from the corresponding range (1 to num_districts[state]).
This method is vectorized, making it more efficient than using a for loop.
This approach should work faster, especially with larger datasets.

To create tests using testthat, the goal is to ensure the integrity of your data and functions. Here are some basic tests you could write based on the dataset you provided.

1. Check for column data types
Ensure each column has the correct type.

r
Copy code
test_that("Columns have correct data types", {
  expect_type(data$poll_id, "double")
  expect_type(data$pollster, "character")
  expect_type(data$numeric_grade, "double")
  expect_type(data$pollscore, "double")
  expect_type(data$methodology, "character")
  expect_type(data$state, "character")
  expect_s3_class(data$start_date, "Date")
  expect_type(data$end_date, "character")
  expect_type(data$sample_size, "double")
  expect_type(data$population, "character")
  expect_type(data$election_date, "character")
  expect_type(data$party, "character")
  expect_type(data$answer, "character")
  expect_type(data$candidate_name, "character")
  expect_type(data$pct, "double")
})
2. Check for missing values
Validate that critical fields like poll_id, pollster, and pct have no missing values.

r
Copy code
test_that("Critical fields have no missing values", {
  expect_false(any(is.na(data$poll_id)))
  expect_false(any(is.na(data$pollster)))
  expect_false(any(is.na(data$pct)))
})
3. Check percentage range
Ensure that the pct values fall between 0 and 100.

r
Copy code
test_that("Percentage values are within valid range", {
  expect_true(all(data$pct >= 0 & data$pct <= 100))
})
4. Ensure sample size is positive
Validate that all sample_size values are positive numbers.

r
Copy code
test_that("Sample sizes are positive", {
  expect_true(all(data$sample_size > 0))
})
5. Test for date consistency
Ensure that start_date occurs before end_date.

r
Copy code
test_that("Start date is before end date", {
  expect_true(all(as.Date(data$start_date) <= as.Date(data$end_date, format="%m/%d/%y")))
})
These tests help catch basic issues like incorrect data types, invalid percentages, or logical errors with dates.

Replace certain values in a column r

ChatGPT
To replace certain values in a column in R, you can use the dplyr package or base R. Here are two approaches:

Using dplyr (Recommended)
First, make sure dplyr is loaded:

R
Copy code
# install.packages("dplyr") # Run this line if you haven't installed dplyr
library(dplyr)

# Example dataframe
df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Alice"))

# Replace "Alice" with "Eve" in the "name" column
df <- df %>%
  mutate(name = ifelse(name == "Alice", "Eve", name))
Using Base R
If you prefer base R, you can use indexing:

R
Copy code
df$name[df$name == "Alice"] <- "Eve"
In both examples, this will replace "Alice" with "Eve" in the name column. Adjust the column name and values as needed!

Rename certain values

ChatGPT
To rename certain values in a column in R, you can use either dplyr or base R. Here’s how:

Using dplyr::recode (for specific replacements)
recode allows you to rename specific values directly:

R
Copy code
# Load dplyr
library(dplyr)

# Example dataframe
df <- data.frame(name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Alice"))

# Rename specific values in the "name" column
df <- df %>%
  mutate(name = recode(name, "Alice" = "Eve", "Bob" = "Robert"))
Using Base R with ifelse
For simple replacements, ifelse works well:

R
Copy code
# Rename values in the "name" column
df$name <- ifelse(df$name == "Alice", "Eve", df$name)
df$name <- ifelse(df$name == "Bob", "Robert", df$name)
In both examples, adjust the column name and values as needed! This will rename "Alice" to "Eve" and "Bob" to "Robert" in the name column.

ChatGPT
To ensure your simulated polling dataset is comprehensive and accurate, you can conduct a variety of tests, covering everything from data integrity and structure to distribution checks and basic statistical validations. Here’s a breakdown of some useful test categories and specific tests you can run.

1. Data Structure and Consistency Checks
Column Types: Confirm that each column has the expected data type (e.g., poll_id as integer, state as character, sample_size as integer, percent as numeric).
r
Copy code
str(simulated_data)
Unique Identifiers: Check that poll_id values are unique.
r
Copy code
any(duplicated(simulated_data$poll_id))
Valid Values for Columns: Verify that categorical columns (like state, population, candidate) only contain expected values.
r
Copy code
unique(simulated_data$state)
unique(simulated_data$population)
unique(simulated_data$candidate)
2. Range and Boundary Checks
Date Range: Ensure that end_date is within the specified date range (2024-07-21 to 2024-10-30).
r
Copy code
range(simulated_data$end_date)
Sample Size Range: Check if sample_size values are reasonable (e.g., within 100–2000 for typical poll sizes).
r
Copy code
summary(simulated_data$sample_size)
Percent Range: Confirm that percent values are within 0–100.
r
Copy code
any(simulated_data$percent < 0 | simulated_data$percent > 100)
3. Distributional Checks
Expected Means by State: Since the simulated percent values are generated with different means per state, validate that the actual means align with the expected state-specific means. This ensures the normal distribution parameters are being applied as intended.

r
Copy code
simulated_data %>%
  group_by(state, candidate) %>%
  summarise(mean_percent = mean(percent), .groups = "drop")
Distribution of Pollsters and Populations: Check if the distribution of pollster and population matches the specified probabilities.

r
Copy code
prop.table(table(simulated_data$pollster))
prop.table(table(simulated_data$population))
4. Basic Statistical Tests
Mean Comparison Between Candidates per State: Conduct t-tests to check if the percent for each candidate has significant differences by state, aligning with the means you set (e.g., Trump’s lower mean in NY vs. Harris’s higher mean).
r
Copy code
simulated_data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(p_value = t.test(percent ~ candidate)$p.value)
5. Missing Values and NA Checks
Check for NAs: Ensure there are no unexpected missing values.
r
Copy code
colSums(is.na(simulated_data))
6. Integrity of Saved File
File Validation: After saving the dataset, reload and confirm it’s identical to simulated_data.
r
Copy code
saved_data <- read_csv("data/simulated_data/simulated_data.csv")
identical(simulated_data, saved_data)
Each test checks a different aspect of your data, helping ensure your simulation is complete, accurate, and aligns with the intended setup.

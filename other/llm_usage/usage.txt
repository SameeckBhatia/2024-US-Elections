Create a key-value pair connecting the following vectors:
states <- c("AL", "AK", "AR", "AZ", "CA", "CO", "CT")
districts <- c(7, 1, 9, 4, 52, 8, 5)

ChatGPT
To create a key-value pair connecting the states and districts vectors, you can use the setNames() function to associate each state with its corresponding district. Here's how you can do it:

r
Copy code
states <- c("AL", "AK", "AR", "AZ", "CA", "CO", "CT")
districts <- c(7, 1, 9, 4, 52, 8, 5)

state_district_map <- setNames(districts, states)
Now, state_district_map is a named vector where each state is the key, and the corresponding district is the value:

r
Copy code
print(state_district_map)
# AL  AK  AR  AZ  CA  CO  CT 
#  7   1   9   4  52   8   5 
You can access the district of any state by referencing its key, e.g., state_district_map["CA"] will return 52.

Is there a more efficient way to go about this:
districts <- c()

for(i in 1:n){
  districts[i] <- sample(1:num_districts[simulated_data$state[i]], 1)
}

simulated_data$district <- districts

ChatGPT
Yes, you can make the district assignment process more efficient by avoiding the loop and instead using vectorized operations. The goal is to assign districts based on the number of districts per state without having to loop through each row. You can achieve this by using mapply() or unlist(lapply()), which are more efficient than a for loop in R.

Here’s an optimized approach using mapply():

r
Copy code
# Assuming num_districts is a named vector that provides the number of districts for each state
num_districts <- c("AL" = 7, "AK" = 1, "AR" = 9, "AZ" = 4, "CA" = 52, "CO" = 8, "CT" = 5)

# Use mapply to efficiently assign random districts based on the state
simulated_data$district <- mapply(function(state) sample(1:num_districts[state], 1),
                                  simulated_data$state)
Explanation:
mapply() applies the sample() function across each state in simulated_data$state, assigning a random district from the corresponding range (1 to num_districts[state]).
This method is vectorized, making it more efficient than using a for loop.
This approach should work faster, especially with larger datasets.

To create tests using testthat, the goal is to ensure the integrity of your data and functions. Here are some basic tests you could write based on the dataset you provided.

1. Check for column data types
Ensure each column has the correct type.

r
Copy code
test_that("Columns have correct data types", {
  expect_type(data$poll_id, "double")
  expect_type(data$pollster, "character")
  expect_type(data$numeric_grade, "double")
  expect_type(data$pollscore, "double")
  expect_type(data$methodology, "character")
  expect_type(data$state, "character")
  expect_s3_class(data$start_date, "Date")
  expect_type(data$end_date, "character")
  expect_type(data$sample_size, "double")
  expect_type(data$population, "character")
  expect_type(data$election_date, "character")
  expect_type(data$party, "character")
  expect_type(data$answer, "character")
  expect_type(data$candidate_name, "character")
  expect_type(data$pct, "double")
})
2. Check for missing values
Validate that critical fields like poll_id, pollster, and pct have no missing values.

r
Copy code
test_that("Critical fields have no missing values", {
  expect_false(any(is.na(data$poll_id)))
  expect_false(any(is.na(data$pollster)))
  expect_false(any(is.na(data$pct)))
})
3. Check percentage range
Ensure that the pct values fall between 0 and 100.

r
Copy code
test_that("Percentage values are within valid range", {
  expect_true(all(data$pct >= 0 & data$pct <= 100))
})
4. Ensure sample size is positive
Validate that all sample_size values are positive numbers.

r
Copy code
test_that("Sample sizes are positive", {
  expect_true(all(data$sample_size > 0))
})
5. Test for date consistency
Ensure that start_date occurs before end_date.

r
Copy code
test_that("Start date is before end date", {
  expect_true(all(as.Date(data$start_date) <= as.Date(data$end_date, format="%m/%d/%y")))
})
These tests help catch basic issues like incorrect data types, invalid percentages, or logical errors with dates.
